# AB Testing

- In A/B test or hypothesis test, the focus is to run an experiment to find out if a reminder email to applicants can increase the likelihood that they will complete the admission exams after creating an account and filling in their details. 

- The experiment uses synthetic data designed to have characteristics that are similar to the real data without exposing personal data - like names, birthdays, and email addresses. 

- The project 0-meet_the applicants focuses in getting to have a better sense of people signing up for the particular online course - where they're from, how old are they, what they previosuly studied, and more.
