# AB Testing

## Overview
- In A/B test or hypothesis test, the focus is to run an experiment to find out if a reminder email to applicants can increase the likelihood that they will complete the admission exams after creating an account and filling in their details.
- The experiment uses synthetic data designed to have characteristics that are similar to the real data without exposing personal data - like names, birthdays, and email addresses.
## About Projects
1. Project [0-meet_the applicants](0-meet_course_applicants.ipynb)  focuses on getting to have a better sense of people signing up for the particular online course - where they're from, how old are they, what they previosuly studied, and more.
